# Pong
Pong is one of the most famous games, simulating table tennis. 
Players use their paddles to strike back and forth on the ball.
Turtle is the inbuilt graphic module in Python which we used in this project.
Steps used:
Step 1) Create two paddles A and B on the left and right side of the screen.
Step 2) Create a ball.
Step 3) Create an event to move the paddle vertically on pressing a certain key.
Step 4) Create the function to update the score after each player misses a collision.
